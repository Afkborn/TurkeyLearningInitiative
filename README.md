# TurkeyLearningInitiative

This repository contains curriculum and course materials for the Turkey Learning Initiative (TLI), a project aimed at providing educational resources to those affected by the recent earthquakes in Turkey.

The goal of TLI is to support learners in continuing their education despite the indefinite suspension of all levels of education, including university education, due to the aftermath of the disaster.

## Contents
In this repository, you will find:

* A comprehensive curriculum covering a variety of subjects
* Detailed course materials, including lecture slides and handouts
* Additional resources, such as recommended readings and exercises


## Getting started
To start learning with the TLI materials, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. The materials are intended to be self-contained, but if you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue in this repository.

## Contributing
